# WeatherApp
During the development of this application, I gained  experience in integrating APIs <br>
and refined my proficiency in SwiftUI. <br>
The application displays the current weather forecast and a randomly selected photograph of the user’s location. <br>

- CLLocationManager to determine the device’s location;
- Mesh Gradient and its animation capabilities. The background display is dependent on the iOS version;
- Practiced creating application icons using Inkscape.

**APIs that I used:**

- [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather forecast. <br>
